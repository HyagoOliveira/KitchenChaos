## Summary

This game is a study case for the game Overcooked! 2.

All art assets like Textures, models, audio clips etc where created by the indie game maker **Code Monkey** for this [Free Complete Unity Course](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg). 

However, the game structure and the source-code were created by me and is very different from the course.


## How To Play

You must prepare, cook and serve up some tasty orders before time ends. Your score will increase according in how quickly you deliver orders.

Only single play is supported but you can switch between chefs to improve the kitchen dynamics.
